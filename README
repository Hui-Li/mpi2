See INSTALL for requirements. Currently mpi2 is not runnable for GCC 6 due to [LOGCXX-400](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOGCXX-400) in log4cxx 0.10.0. According to log, it will be fixed in the next release version of log4cxx.

To run an MPI program on a cluster:
- Type "mpirun --hosts <comma-separated hostlist> <executable> <args>"
- Example: mpirun --hosts localhost,localhost ./build/examples/mpi2/task
